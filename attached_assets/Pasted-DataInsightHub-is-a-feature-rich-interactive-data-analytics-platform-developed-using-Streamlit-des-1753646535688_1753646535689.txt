DataInsightHub is a feature-rich, interactive data analytics platform developed using Streamlit, designed to simplify and streamline the process of data exploration, visualization, and interpretation. It provides an intuitive user interface with a dark-themed layout, responsive tabbed navigation, and modern UI elements such as metric cards and custom-styled components. The dashboard is tailored for both technical and non-technical users, allowing seamless interaction with complex datasets through drag-and-drop file uploads and sidebar controls.

The platform is built around a modular architecture, leveraging several powerful utility modules from the utils directory. The DataProcessor module handles the ingestion, cleaning, and transformation of structured data, ensuring it is ready for analysis. The Visualizations module generates a wide variety of dynamic and interactive visual plots, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and more using Plotly—enabling users to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies with ease. The Statistics module provides automated statistical summaries, calculating key metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, correlations, and distributions to support deeper analytical insights.

A unique aspect of the application is its integrated Resume Analyzer, which extracts and evaluates the content of uploaded resumes to identify relevant skills, match qualifications, and provide feedback—making it highly useful for HR professionals or hiring managers. Complementing this, the Insight Generator module uses heuristics or machine learning-based logic to automatically generate textual interpretations and business insights based on the uploaded data, turning raw numbers into understandable narratives.

Overall, DataInsightHub functions as a powerful, multi-purpose tool ideal for use in domains like business intelligence, human resources analytics, academic research, and more. Its seamless integration of data processing, visualization, statistical computation, resume parsing, and automated insight generation makes it an excellent showcase of full-stack data science and application development using Python.
